		<p>When can I say <em>Un gâteau</em> and when can I say <em>Le gâteau</em>?</p>
		<p><em>Gâteau</em> is a noun and before every noun, there has to be an article or a determiner. This article helps you to know the gender and the number of the noun. Is it several gâteaux? Only one? </p>
		<p><em>Un gâteau</em> is undefined. It's not a specific or a precise or particular gâteau. It's one gâteau among other gâteaux. The listener knows nothing about it.
		</p>
		<p><em>Le gâteau</em> is a defined gâteau. It's a specific and precise gâteau. It's one gâteau in particular and not another one. Also, when you say le gâteau, both the speaker and the listener know which gâteau you are talking about.

		</div>
		
		<div class="SentenceEN">
		<p>This morning, I ate the cake you bought.</p>
		</div>
		
		</div>
	</p>

	<p>In the first sentence, I ate a gâteau and it was not a particular gâteau. There is no specificity to this gâteau.</p>

	<p>In the second sentence, there is a specificity: it was the gâteau that was bought by the listener. So it's not an undefined gâteau, it's this gâteau in particular.</p>

	<div class="EnandFR">If I said, <p class="SentenceFR">ce matin, j'ai mangé le gâteau,</p> then the listener will ask: which one?</div>

<h2>When to use <em>Tu</em> and when to use <em>Vous</em></h2>
</div>

<div class="article">
	
		<div class="Trad">
		<div class="SentenceFR">
		<p>Hover French Examples Sentences to have their translation. Try it with me!</p></div>
		<div class="SentenceEN">
		<p>Yes, juste like this. It will show the meaning in English.</p>

<p>So, like in English, they both mean “you” but there is an additional layer of information regarding the use of these two pronouns.
<br>It’s about <strong>politeness</strong>.<br></p>
<h3>Before I explain that, the first rule is:</h3>
</div>





<div class="containerrule">
<div class="rule">
<p>You use “tu” when you are speaking to one person and “vous” when you are speaking to more than one person.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="article">
<p>But you can also use “vous” when you’re speaking to one person. It’s when you want to add <strong>politeness</strong> to your speech, when you are in a formal situation, in a <strong>formal</strong> environment and you have to be polite. <br>
So here, you use “vous”, even if it’s only one person you’re speaking with.</p>

<h3>Let’s see different situations and see if you have to use “tu” or “vous”.</h3>

<h4>First, with friends and/or family.</h4>
<p>So you totally use “tu”. If you use “vous”, something will be off, it will be unusual. Your friends are more likely to ask: “why are you using ‘vous’ with me? We are friends, right?”.<br>
Same with family.<br> 
<br>The situation where children are using “vous” with their parents exists but it’s very rare, it’s not common at all. And for everyone else, this “vous” from children to parents will be unconventional.
</p>

<h4>Now, what about your boss?</h4>

<p>Initially, the thought would be that you use “vous” because it’s your boss, so you have to be polite, right? But in France, it really depends on the situation.<br>
<br>Let’s say that it’s a small firm and your boss is also your manager. There is no more level of hierarchy between them. So you are likely to speak with your boss a lot, and interact with your boss a lot. It’s more likely that the boss will give the permission to use “tu” with them.<br>

<br>It’s not you who initiates the “tu” first. My advice is always to use “vous” at first and then wait for the manager/boss to give you the authorization. Once it’s done, you switch and you use “tu” instead. If you keep using “vous”, your manager/boss will not understand because they gave you the permission to do so.
This situation is the same with your manager when your manager is not your boss.<br>

<br>Now if you have a manager and a boss and there are two different people, it’s more likely you are not going to interact a lot with your boss boss. You will not see them a lot so it’s important to keep the “vous”, unless they also give you the authorization to use “tu”.
<p>With your colleagues, you’re going to use “tu” because you are on the same hierarchical level as them.</p>

Now, when you're going to the bakery, or shopping or you’re doing groceries, you use “vous”. Because you don’t know them, it’s a formal situation for the employees.If you use “tu”, they can feel uncomfortable because you are using an informal speech in a formal situation. Since you don’t know each other, using “tu” can really make you step into their boundaries.<br>
<br>Even if you are seeing each other every day, like you’re buying your bread in the same bakery every time, there would be some familiarity in the tone, the baker can ask you how are you doing and other friendly questions but it doesn’t always mean that you can switch from “vous” to “tu”.

<p>Also, if at one point in a situation, you’re asking yourself “can I use ‘tu’ with this person”, because you feel that you and the other person are talking in a very friendly atmosphere, you can just ask: “do you prefer to use “tu” or “vous”?”.</p>
As a teacher, when I meet a new student, before using “tu”, I ask them if it’s OK or if they prefer to keep the “vous”. Usually, they say “yes, it’s OK” and then we both know that we can use “tu” with each other.
</p>

</div>
<div class="containerrule">
<div class="rule">
<p>To sum up:
<ul>
	<li>Tu: when you talk to <u><strong>1 person</strong></u></li>
	<li>Vous: when you talk to <u><strong>more than 1 person</strong></u></li>
	<li>Vous: when you talk <u><strong>politely to 1 person</strong></u></li>
	<li>If you're not sure, <u>ask politely if the person prefers TU or VOUS</u></li>
	</ul>
	</p>

		<div class="Trad">
		<div class="SentenceFR">
		<p>Elle lui dira.</p></div>
		<div class="SentenceEN">
		<p>She will say to him/her.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="Trad">
		<div class="SentenceFR">
		<p>Elle le dira.</p></div>
		<div class="SentenceEN">
		<p>She will say it.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		
		
		
		<p>In the first sentence, the sentence answers to the question: Elle dira à qui ? She will say to whom? "Lui" refers to someone.</p>
		<p>In the second sentence, the sentence answers to the question: Elle dira quoi ? She will say what? "Le" refers to something. It can also refers to someone in other
		sentences.</p>
		<p>The difference is in the "a". A is a preposition. When there is a preposition (like "a" or "de"), the word or group of words that come after is a COI. 
		COI means <em>Complément d'objet indirect</em>. It means that it is an indirect object. And to refer to a COI, you have to use "lui" or "leur" if it's plural.</p>
		<p>When there is no preposition in the question, then it means that it is a COD, <em>Complément d'objet direct</em> and to refer to a COD, you use "le" or "la"
		if it's a feminine word or "les" if it's plural.</p>
		
		<p>Let's take another example</p>
	
		
	
		<div class="Trad">
		<div class="SentenceFR">
		<p>Je vais appeler Caroline pour dire à Caroline. Je vais l'appeler pour lui dire.</p></div>
		<div class="SentenceEN">
		<p>I will call Caroline to say to Caroline. I will call her to tell her.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		
		</div>

		<div class="article">
		<p>Je vais appeler qui ? It's a COD. So to refer to the woman Caroline, we use la. And because "appeler" begins with a vowel, we use an apostrophe.</p>
		<p>Pour dire à qui ? It's a COI. So to refer to the woman Caroline, we use lui.</p>
		
		
		</div>
		
		<div class="containerrule">
		<div class="rule">
		<p>Le/La/Les refer to a direct object and it answers the question: qui? quoi?</p>
		<p>Lui/leur refer to an indirect object and it answers the question: à qui? à quoi ? de qui ? de quoi ?</p>
		</div>
